 Understanding your hair type is important because it allows you to find natural hair bloggers that best resemble your indiviudal jounrey. This natural hair jounrey can be long
            and extremely tedious. Thus, kowing your hair type can make it that much easier to find products that best complement your hair. In addition to understanding
            your curl pattern, it is also important understand the porosity of your hair. If you hair is low porosity then it has trouble absorbing moisture, whereas, if you hair
            is high porosity then your hair has a really easy time of abosrbing moisture, thus you shouldn't moisture as often as someone with low porosity hair.    </h3>
